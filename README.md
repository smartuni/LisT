# LisT

Living in a smart Tank is the smart solution for every aquarium owner!  
Observe and regulate your aquarium. Light, temperature and even the PH-value.

## The Idea in detail

Based on the RIOT-OS (https://github.com/RIOT-OS), we use sensors to monitor the three chosen values.  
Temperature, light and the PH-value.  
These values will be processed on a Raspberry Pie. The processed data will be saved in a database system.  
These data will be used to show your aquarium statistics in a Web application.  
Even further you'll be able to regulate your temperature and your light from all over the world. The PH-value on the other side is something special. You'll need to regulate it manually, so LisT will give you an alert, if the PH-Value differs from the default range.

## Features

* self-regulating light, that will adapt to the light outside
* self-regulating temperature, that will adept to your default temperature
* monitored PH-Value, that will alarm you, if it differs from the default range
* online statistics to your values and the possibility to change the defaults

## Getting started

## Setting up the hardware

To use our system, you'll need the following hardware:

* 1x Raspberry Pie
* 1x light sensor (desc tba)
* 1x PH-sensor (desc tba)
* 1x temperature sensor (desc tba)
* 1x heating element (desc tba)
* 1x light elements (desc tba)
